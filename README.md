# 📊 Econometric Analyses of Health Factors: Cigarette Consumption and Water Potability 🌊

## Overview 👀
This repository houses two separate econometric studies:
1. **Cigarette Consumption Analysis** using panel data to explore the effects of various factors on cigarette consumption across U.S. states.
2. **Water Potability Analysis** utilizing logistic, probit, and linear probability models to determine factors affecting water's potability.

## Objectives 🎯
- **Cigarette Consumption**: Analyze state-by-state cigarette consumption using econometric models to understand impacts of socioeconomic factors.
- **Water Potability**: Evaluate water safety across different samples using statistical models to predict potability based on chemical properties.

## Methodology 🔍
### Cigarette Consumption
- **Panel Data Models**: Pooled, fixed effects, and random effects models are employed to analyze the impact of taxes, prices, and other factors on cigarette packs consumed.
### Water Potability
- **Binary Outcome Models**: Linear probability, probit, and logit models analyze how chemical properties like pH, hardness, and turbidity affect water's safety for consumption.

## Data Analysis 📊
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summaries, box plots, and correlation matrices provide insights into data distribution and variable relationships.
- **Regression Analysis**: Extensive model fitting to evaluate predictor significance on outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, and more to visually interpret data behaviors and model fits.

## Results 📝
- Discover significant predictors of cigarette consumption patterns and critical factors determining water potability.
- Detailed model comparisons to choose the best fit for predictive accuracy.
